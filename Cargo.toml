[dependencies]
# 1. ALLOY (The Anchor)
# Pinned to =1.1.0 to fit your Rust 1.84 compiler.
# We KEEP 'full' here, so Alloy provides the single allowed copy of c-kzg (v2.1.1).
alloy = { version = "=1.1.0", features = ["full", "pubsub", "rpc-types-eth", "sol-types"] }

# 2. REVM (The Amputation)
# CRITICAL FIX: 'default-features = false' disables the conflicting 'c-kzg' dependency.
# We manually re-enable 'std' and 'serde' so the bot still runs, but without the conflict.
revm = { version = "=8.0.0", default-features = false, features = ["std", "serde", "optional_no_base_fee"] }

# DO NOT ADD A [PATCH] SECTION.
# Since we removed the conflict in REVM, the patch is no longer needed.
