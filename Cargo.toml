# 1. ALLOY (Stripped to avoid c-kzg conflict)
# We manually add 'rpc-client' and transports to fix the connection.

    "std", 
    "reqwest", 
    "pubsub",            # Critical for WsConnect
    "rpc-types-eth",
    "sol-types",
    "providers",
    "transport-ws",      # Websocket support
    "transport-http",    # HTTP support
    "signer-local",
    "network",
    "contract",
    "rpc-client"         # <--- Fixes connection logic
] }

# 2. REVM (Standard v25)
# REMOVE "default-features = false".
# We need defaults so the 'EVM' struct and 'db' module are compiled.
# Since Alloy is stripped, this is safe.
revm = "25.0.0"

# 3. UTILITIES
# REMOVED revm-primitives (It causes version conflicts)
